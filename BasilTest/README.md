This repository contains the extended version of the BASIL dataset from "In Plain Sight: Media Bias Through the Lens of Factual Reporting" paper (refer to the below bibtex for detail). The NEUTRAL articles in BASIL dataset are collected from news outlets that are not considered fully "neutral". Therefore, we manually crawled new version of articles from more neutral outlets such as Reuters and CNN.
